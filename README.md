# dotfiles_ubuntu_server

My dotfiles include custom configurations for Vim and Tmux on an Ubuntu server, which are two essential tools in my workflow.

In my .vimrc file, I have configured Vim to suit my text editing preferences on the Ubuntu server. I have customized key bindings, enabled syntax highlighting, and added productivity-enhancing plugins such as NERDTree, which provides easy and quick navigation through project files.

As for Tmux, I have created a customized .tmux.conf file that allows me to work with multiple windows and panels simultaneously in the same server terminal session. I have customized key bindings for quick and easy access to my most used commands, added plugins such as Tmuxinator for creating preconfigured Tmux sessions, and enabled clipboard synchronization for greater convenience.

Overall, my Vim and Tmux dotfiles allow me to work more efficiently and comfortably on the Ubuntu server, and allow me to customize my working environment according to my needs and preferences.
